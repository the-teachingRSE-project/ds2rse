# Introduction
Computers and software have played a key role in the research life cycle for many decades.
They are now vital elements of the research process across almost all domains.
They enable researchers to collect and process ever-increasing amounts of data, simulate a wide range of physical phenomena across previously unexplored scales of the universe, and discover previously inconceivably complex structures in nature and societies via machine learning (ML).
This prevalence of computation and digitally-aided data analysis in research means that digital skills are now required by researchers at all career levels, and in fields significantly beyond those that would previously have been expected. Research software is now used and developed not only in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) domains, but also in other fields, like medicine and the humanities.

Researchers often lack the skills to use specialised software for their research, let alone write it.
If they come from a non-technical domain, they may also struggle to know what to ask when trying to request help from and interact with more experienced colleagues. Therefore there is an increasing demand for support personel that interfaces between
researchers and their digital tools. To fill this gap a variety of roles have come up, that we try to quickly describe for the
unaware reader. In this paper we focus on the RSE and the Data scientist and only touch research data management
in order to give a complete picture

## Definition/Terms

### Research Software Engineer

A recent shift towards the establishment of the distinct role of a “Research Software Engineer" (RSE, a term that was coined in the United
Kingdom (UK) a little over 10 years ago), now provides a base on which sustainable career opportunities can be (and are being) built, allowing for better training of researchers and more effective support for the development of high quality research software.

RSEs may work within one of the increasing number of research software engineering teams that have been set up at universities and research organisations over the past decade, or they may be embedded within a research team. They may have a job title that officially recognises them as an RSE, or they may have a standard research or technical job title such as Research Assistant, Research Fellow, or Software Engineer.
Regardless of their job title, RSEs share a set of core skills that are required to design and develop research software, understand the research environment, and ensure that they produce sustainable, maintainable code that supports reproducible research outputs, following the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability (FAIR) principles.

Research Software Engineering can be considered an interface discipline, linking traditional Software Engineering with Research itself.
Due to this nature there is a plethora of different variations of RSE depending on the particular Research domain they are working in.
Therefore, the broad notion of Research Software Engineers is better thought of as a collection of sub-communities.
The term Research Software Engineer is made more difficult to grasp since an internationally recognised definition is still missing.
While there is consensus about the general notion that an RSE is a person with one leg in their research domain and the other in software development, this spans a whole spectrum depending on which one is more emphasised.
Common to all of them is, that they need to be able to work in the research environment the software is used in, ideally at eye-level with native researchers, but at least as close as possible. RSEs often need to deal with non-technical complexities that are characteristic for research environments: organisational, motivational, with respect to the size of projects, independence and heterogeneous goals of stakeholders, boundary conditions for funding and future funding, to name just a few. Summarising, RSEs have skills and experience in three important areas: in the research area(s) their software is used in, in software engineering topics, as well as in interdisciplinary communication.

### Data Scientists
A data scientist is a professional who analyzes and interprets complex data to help organizations make informed decisions. They use skills in statistics, programming, and machine learning to uncover patterns, trends, and insights from large datasets. Data scientists often build predictive models, design experiments, and communicate results through visualizations and reports.
In academia a data scientist could collaborate with faculty on academic research projects, applying data analysis techniques to disciplines like social science, biology, or education.

### Research Data Managers
Research Data Managers focus on the provision of structures for the management of research data
These can be organizational, educational and the respective infrastructures.
They are responsible for organizing, storing, and maintaining the integrity of data collected during research projects. They develop and implement data management plans, ensuring data is accurate, secure, and compliant with legal and ethical standards in order to
improve the handling of research data at every point in the data cycle (FIXME: Insert picture of data cycle)
They work closely with researchers to support data collection, cleaning, documentation, and sharing. Additionally, research data managers often facilitate data archiving and ensure that data is accessible for future use or replication.

### Comparison
While there is overlap between these fields,
we can summarise, that RSEs focus on the creation of software in order to facilitate research using their SE skills.
Research data management focus on providing structures for the data that is generated during the research process and try
to provide structures for better provisioning of the data.
Data Scientists focus on gaining insight from the data that is generated somewhere at an organisation and are thereby not tied to
an academic working place.


# What has been discussed

When discussing competences for research software engineers as the basis of a curriculum to train Research Software Engineers professionals it is logical to look at the data science movement for inspiration.
Similar to Research Software Engineering (RSE), Data Science (DS) is a cross-cutting field that focuses on a special area within the sciences or data oriented businesses.

The major computing organizations ACM and IEEE published a joint recommended computing curriculum which already included data science: the Computing Curriculum 2020 [@CC2020] already lists DS as one of the special cases for computing competences.
Whilst DS is mentioned, research software engineering was absent.

There are existing bodies of knowledge (BOKs) for both software engineering [@SWEBOK2014] and data science [@DSBOK2017], each offering a comprehensive mapping of knowledge areas among themselves and in relation to the ACM computing curriculum.
However, the connection between competencies and the corresponding knowledge canon remains complex and nuanced.
 Some competencies are almost the equivalent to a knowledge based learning goal whereas others integrate several knowledge areas with active application skills.
 For the intent of this paper the additional mapping of knowledge areas to competency would be out of scope. However, the idea of outlining the fields and mapping corresponding aspects can be transferred analogously.

![Intersecting Areas](img/ds_rse_rdm_se.png){#fig-cycles width=60%}

The DS-BOK maps data science not only to software engineering but also to (research) data management (RDM). This is interesting as RDM is another intersecting cycle. @fig-cycles shows the assumed relationship between the prominent fields of discussion.

Depending on the point of view RSE could be conceived as a subclass of DS or the other way around. In contrast, it takes a closer look on the interlinkage between the fields taking account of both the common competencies needed to be successful and the competencies that are specific to one of the areas.

# Comparative Analysis of DS and RSE Competencies

In the following the contents of [@GI2021DataScience] is parsed as the most current examples
of data science curricula in the German research context. The contents are inspected for obvious links to the research process
and interpreted if no explicit connections are made. Further sources for data science curriculum is the output of the Edison Project [@EDSF2017] and the OpenDS4all Project [@OpenDS4All2020].

For the RSE side the contents of [@Goth2024RSE] are used as a basis as well as the current state of the RSE-Curriculums project [@RSECurriculums2021]. For the RSE competencies the RSE community has developed short codes. These are attached in the glossary in the attached repository [@ds2rse2025].

In addition, relevant competences from the research data management field [@petersen_2025_15025246] are included as they intersect with both DS and RSE.

In terms of methodology it should be noted that this approach follows a community-driven consensus building. It should not be mistaken for a review study with measurable intersubjectivity based on instruments like PRISMA [@Page2021PRISMA].

The lists of extracted DS and RSE competency clusters can be found in [@ds2rse2025]. We also plan to publish a full table of RSE competencies (and possible DS competencies) sorted by clusters. In terms of this top-level discussion the competency clusters are sufficient to compare the differences with regard to the research cycle.
