## DS and RSE Competences in relation to the Research Cycle
The RSE competencies can be structured into three major pillars as done in [@Goth2024].
Those are: a research pillar, indicating that RSEs have a deep knowledge how science works, at best enabling them to participate in research,
a software/technical skills pillar, that enable them to write proper software for science,
and a team skills pillar, to work well in interdisciplinary teams.
Their specialization on software makes RSEs an instance of RTPs(research technical professional) that work to support science.

_1. Conceptualization_

**RSE Competencies:**

- Understanding the research cycle (`RC`)
- Conducting and leading research (`NEW`)

**Data Science Competencies:**

- Understanding the Data Science Lifecycle and methods selection
- Awareness of data context, purpose, and interdisciplinary implications (ethics, economics, legal)


_2. Design_

**RSE Competencies:**

- Software Design
- Software discovery & re-use strategies  (`SRU`)
- Creating documented code building blocks (`DOCBB`)
