## DS and RSE Competences in relation to the Research Cycle
The RSE competencies can be structured into four major pillars as done in [@Goth2024].
It is a research pillar, indicating that RSEs have a deep knowledge how science works, at best enabling them to participate in research.
software skills, that enable them to write proper software for science,
and team skills, to work well in interdisciplinary teams.
Their specialization on software makes some RSEs an instance of RTPs (research technical professional) that work to support science.

_1. Conceptualization_

**RSE Competencies:**

- Understanding the research cycle (`RC`)
- Conducting and leading research (`NEW`)

**Data Science Competencies:**

- Understanding the Data Science Lifecycle and methods selection
- Awareness of data context, purpose, and interdisciplinary implications (ethics, economics, legal)


_2. Design_

**RSE Competencies:**

- Software Design
- Software discovery & re-use strategies  (`SRU`)
- Creating documented code building blocks (`DOCBB`)

- Full-Stack Programming

**Data Science Competencies:**

- Data integration & feature engineering (ETL, pipelines, quality checks)
- Design of data workflows and modeling processes
- Visualization theory and editorial thinking (exploratory analysis)
- Algorithm selection and objective function definition (ML core)
- Designing responsible data usage frameworks (ethics, privacy)
- Data-oriented Programming (R, Python, Matlab etc.)


_3. Implementation_

**RSE Competencies:**

_5. Dissemination_

**RSE Competencies:**

- Software publication and citation (`SP`)
- Use of domain repositories (`DOMREP`)
- Teaching and communication (`TEACH`, `USERS`)

**Data Science Competencies:**
